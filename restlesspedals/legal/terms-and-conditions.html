    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="lead">These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Android game <strong>Restless Pedals</strong> and any associated services provided by the game's developer.</p>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 3, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>The Game is
          developed by Dobre G Daniel PFA ("the developer"). By installing, accessing, or using Restless Pedals you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the game.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The date at the top of this page is the date the current Terms took effect. When we make material changes we will post the updated Terms within the app or on the game's store listing and update the Effective Date. Your continued use after the Effective Date of updated Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. License and Use</h2>
    <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use Restless Pedals on Android devices that you own or control.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Local Storage & Caching</h2>
    <p>Restless Pedals uses local storage on your device for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Persisting user preferences and settings (for example: audio volume, control layout, display options).</li>
      <li>Caching content downloaded from remote servers to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage (for example: images, level data, or other game assets).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cached or locally stored data may remain on your device after you stop using the app unless you explicitly clear the app data or uninstall the app. Clearing app data or uninstalling will typically remove locally stored settings and caches. Some cached data may be re-downloaded when you next use the app.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Remote Content and Updates</h2>
    <p>The game may load content from remote servers (updates, game assets, events, promotions, or configuration). We may modify, remove, or add remote content at any time. You agree that certain features may stop working if remote content is changed or removed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Accounts and Sign-in</h2>
    <p>Restless Pedals does not require an account to play (unless you opt in to features that need a sign-in). If account-based features are offered (for example, online leaderboards or cloud sync), they will be presented to you and require your consent. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials and for activity under your account.</p>

  <p>All accounts, progress, and associated game assets in <strong>Restless Pedals</strong> are the property of the account holder but may not be sold, traded, or transferred to any other person or entity without our explicit written consent. Attempting to sell, buy, or otherwise transfer accounts or in-game items outside the official game platform is strictly prohibited. Violations may result in suspension or permanent termination of the account.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>Restless Pedals is <strong>not</strong> specifically targeted at children. If you are a parent or guardian and learn that your child under applicable age laws provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us and we will take steps to remove such information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Purchases and In-App Billing</h2>
    <p>If the game offers in-app purchases, those transactions will be processed through the applicable app store (e.g., Google Play). All payments, refunds, and billing disputes are subject to the store’s policies in addition to these Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All game content, including but not limited to art, music, text, code, and designs, is owned or licensed by the developer.
